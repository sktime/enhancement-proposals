# Rethinking sktime documentation structure

In the current state, sktime documentation is comprehensive and explain most of the features of the library. However, it is worth rethinking its structure. Some negative feedbacks about sktime are focused on the documentation, since, for new users, they are really dense in information and can be confusing.

This step proposes rethinking sktime documentation with a focus on the user experience. The first exercise is defining the different personas that might be interested in the package, and how would be the best organization for their purpose. The current state is dense and might be best for the ones already familiar with Python and advanced features of dependencies, such as pandas and multiindex.


## Personas

We can identify the following personas:

* **User A**: Student, Junior, new to timeseries
* **User B**: knows scikit-learn API, needs-production grade pipelines
* **User C**: Academic Researcher, wants to benchmark and create new models
* **User D**: OSS contributor, Python developer
* **User E**: familiar to other timeseries packages, want to compare and get to know sktime.

In general, the user will be interested in a specific timeseries task: Forecasting, Classification, Clustering, Detection, or Regression.

## Proposed information architecture

Home | Get Started | Tutorial | How-to | Estimator Overview | API Reference | Get Involved | More â–¾


### Home

This is what users see first when they access sktime's documentation. We should highlight the versatility of the package. A suggestion would be highlighting how one can change `NaiveForecaster` to `Chronos`/`NBEATS` in 1 line of code to produce forecasts with a state-of-the-art model.

We could also have links for the different personas, e.g.:


* New to timeseries forecasting? Go to the univariate forecasting tutorial
* Researcher? Check-out how to benchmark your models
* Scikit-learn user? Learn how to use regressors for forecasting
* Want to contribute? Check-out the contributing guidelines

Also adding discord, linkedin urls.
